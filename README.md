# Multi-Function-Console-Program

Hello there! This is the final project written for code in place 2024. 

I was originally thinking about altering it so that it can be deployed as a web application, but did not figure out how to do so (yet), if you have any idea or suggestion, please do not hesitate in reaching out!! I eagearly want to know more about producing and deploying web applications other than writing console programs!

This is a **multi-function program** that does *3 things*:

1. **Calculates BMI** given height and weight in chosen units
2. **Checks** if the given **blood pressure** is in the normal range
3. **Calculates suggested daily water intake amount**, meaning *how many bottle of water should be consumed each day* given weight and user-prompted size of water bottle in chosen units

If you want to exit the program, simply enter "4" when the program prompts you to choose which program to run. 
This program would continously prompt you to choose one of the subprograms to run, so if you want to terminate the program entirely, simply enter the number "4" (without the double quotes)!

If you like this project idea, do not hesitate to leave a star hahaha, happy coding, HAVE FUN!
